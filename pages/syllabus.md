Given the amount of extra credit offered throughout the quarter, grades are not rounded up.

### Grades
Grades are released on Gradescope a week after the submission date and sometimes sooner. Ultimately it is your responsibility to check your final grade and get in touch if you believe there is a problem.

### Regrade Policy
The regrade policy is here to protect students from serious issues in grading, not to provide students with a platform to argue about or plead for an extra point. When we regrade, we closely go through the entire assignment again and reevaluate it as a whole. This means your grade can either stay the same, go up, or go down. This is not to discourage students from requesting legitimate regrades, but to discourage students from *just* arguing for points (without merit).

**If you think a grading error has occurred please follow these steps:**
- You have 72 hours to request a regrade
- Initiate the regrade through Gradescope (if it is a group project, confer w/ your team first and submit one regrade after your team comes to a consensus)
- Provide evidence for why your answer is correct and merits a regrade (i.e. a specific reference to something said in a lecture, the readings, or office hours)
- We will get back to you within 48 hours after regrades close with our final decision.

### Lecture Attendance
Our goal is to make lectures and office hours worthwhile to attend (e.g. lots of in-class discussion). However, lecture attendance is not required. All lectures will be recorded. These will be made available to you (UCSD podcast). That said, we have found that students who come to lecture and are engaged fully learn the most (which is our goal!) and hope that you'll attend lecture. 

### Readings & Reflections
This course will be reading heavy. There will be reading assigned from the textbook, online resources, primary academic research, review papers, and scientific magazines. To help keep you from falling behind, by midnight before each class weeks 1-9, you will submit a short form reflecting on the day's assigned readings. While reading will be time-consuming, completing your reflection will not be, so long as you've completed and thought critically about the assigned reading. Thoughtful responses that indicate students completed the readings while thinking critically (even if they contain mistakes/misunderstandings/uncertainties) will receive full credit. Students will be required to use their UCSD google accounts to access/complete their reading reflections.

Reading reflections can be submitted up to a week late for half credit. 


### Final Project


#### Proposal

Once your group of 4-5 students has formed (process to be discussed in class), you will decide on a topic (either a behavior or a model organism) and begin to search the academic literature for papers related to the topic of that behavior/organism and genetics. Your behavior/model organism can be one that we discuss in class, but you are not limited to these. Your proposal will include 1) your topic 2) 4-5 primary references *not assigned to be read in class* that you'll likely use in your final report (groups of 4 must have at least 4; groups of 5 must have at least 5) and 3) a one paragraph, brief summary of each reference.

#### Proposal Meeting

During class time of week 8, each group will meet with an instructional staff member for a 20 minute meeting (virtual is an option) to discuss their project proposal and plans going forward. Students will receive feedback during this session and are encouraged to bring questions.

#### Report

Each group will turn in an 8-10 page report (double-spaced; 1 in margins) taking a deep dive into either: 1) a model organism or 2) a behavior and its relationship to behavior genetics.

#### Presentation

Each group will also prepare an 8-10 minute presentation on their topic. Each group member must take part in and "appear" (speak) in the presentation. Groups will submit their recorded presentation via Canvas. Groups will have the option to present in class during the final week of class for extra credit (and will not be required to record their presentation).


#### Submissions

- For the proposal and final report, one submission through Gradescope per group
- One PDF submission per group (ensure all your names and PIDs are on the PDF and that each group member is added to the group on Gradescope)
- Your team may resubmit as many times as you like before the deadline
- Late submissions:
  - Late assignments have 5 points deducted within the first 24 hours, and an additional 5 points during the following 24 hours.
  - No late assignments accepted after 48 hours.



### Exams
The midterm and final exam are an opportunity for me to test how all of you are learning the course material. The best way to study for the exam is to carefully review the readings and your lecture notes, think about the main topics in the lectures, and then determine the details that support each of those topics. 

- Available for at least 24 hours on Gradescope
- You have 2 continuous hours to finish once started
- One attempt
- Open notes and open Google/ChatGPT/etc., but you must work alone
- Taken and submitted through Gradescope

No late exams are permitted, except for extenuating circumstances. Please reach out to staff as early as possible if you know something will prevent you from taking the exam on time.

{: .important }
The exam is an open note exam, open-Internet (Google, ChatGPT, etc. are all OK) to be taken at the comfort of your own home. Once you begin an exam, however, you must finish it in one sitting.


## Other Good Stuff

### Class/Web Conduct
In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the UC San Diego [principles of the community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).

This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.

At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.

If you have a concern, please speak with Prof Ellis or your TAs. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that’s ok! The [OPHD](https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html) (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and [CARE](https://care.ucsd.edu/) (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.


### Academic Integrity
Don't cheat.

You are encouraged to (and at times will have to) work together and help one another. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit (readings/exams). For projects, it is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything your group has submitted and to make sure the correct file has been uploaded, that the upload is uncorrupted, and that it renders correctly. Projects may include ideas from other sources, but these other sources must be documented with clear attribution. Please review academic integrity policies [here](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu).

We anticipate you all doing well in this course; however, if you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, that’s ok! Should that occur, we recommend: (i.) asking questions in/after class, (ii.) attending office hours, and/or (iii.) reaching out to course staff.

Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, this website or Gradescope is down, or something else prohibits you from being able to turn something in on time, immediately contact course staff via email (attach your assignment if possible) or else it will be graded as late.

### Disability Access
Students requesting accommodations due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. These will be sent to the instructor once submitted, and you will receive a response confirming receipt and discussing the accomodations as necessary. However, if you are struggling to get necessary accommodations or want to further discuss your accommodations, please feel free to reach out directly.

Contacting the OSD can help you further:

### Difficult Life Situations

Sometimes life outside of academia can be difficult. Please [email me](mailto:sellis@ucsd.edu) or come to office hours if stuff outside the classroom prevents you from doing well inside it. 

If you don't have the most essential resources required to thrive as a student, please contact [UCSD Basic Needs](https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu) who can help you access nutritious food and stable housing, and help you seek the means to reach financial wellness.

If you need emergency food, finances, and/or academic and social support you can also contact [UCSD Mutual Aid](https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com). They provide mentoring and aid that comes from volunteers among your peers.  If you don't need that kind of support, consider joining them in helping your fellow classmates who do.

If you need counseling or if you are in a mental crisis you can contact [CAPS](https://caps.ucsd.edu). They provide psychiatric services, workshops, and counseling; they also operate a 24/7 crisis hotline at 858.534.3755.
